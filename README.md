# pathfinder
Pathfinder system find shortest route between two terminal for baggage routing.
Here, I have used Hipster Library (http://www.hipster4j.org/), an open source library to figure out shortest 
path between the two nodes. Dependent jar files are attached here too. 

This is eclipse project, can be executed in eclipse environment as it is.
